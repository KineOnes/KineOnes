## 🌿 About Me

Hi there! I'm Kine, a 36-year-old from Norway diving into the creative tech world.

With a background in Art History, Graphic Design (Oslo), and Illustration (Trondheim), I bring a strong visual eye into front-end development. I love combining clean structure with Scandinavian simplicity to create intuitive and beautiful user experiences.

Currently studying Front-End Development at Noroff and building modern web applications using React, JavaScript, and Tailwind.
